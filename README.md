# This is the implementation of Image Processing with 3D ToF (Time of Flight) Camera with C++.

## I implemented this project in Germany. That's the reason some of codes or comments is written German.

## In this project I used OpenCV and a library that called ***royale***

###### The purpose of this project is to fill the grids on paper with black color, and then on the paper under the 3D ToF camera, wherever the fingers is located, the grid on the location that fingers located will take on a random color and then a random letter will appear.

###### To summarize, we can think of the grids as the keys of the piano and the color of the relevant grid when hovering over it and appearing a random letter.

###### In addition, whichever direction the paper is turned, the colors and letters in the grid will rotate in that direction.
